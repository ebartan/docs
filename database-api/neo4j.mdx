<Warning>LLMs sometimes produce inaccurate or false information, known as "hallucinations," due to their reliance on patterns from large amounts of training data. These inaccuracies can result from overfitting, biases in the data, and the model's attempts to generalize.</Warning>

<Warning>The complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their training on potentially flawed data can lead to unpredictable or inaccurate outputs. For instance, an LLM might generate biased or incorrect responses to controversial topics. Additionally, it can be challenging to trace how the model reached a particular conclusion.</Warning>
